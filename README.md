Welcome to my Github repository! 

🖥 I have recently graduated from Nanyang Technological University with a Computer Engineering Bachelor Degree. I have interest in Artificial Intelligence and programming simple microcontrollers like Arduino. As you can see from my projects, they are mostly Artificial Intelligence and IoT based.
